# Web-API-Code-Quiz

## Description 

For this application I created a web API quiz that a user can test their knowledge on.
With this application I was able to use my skills in making a timer countdown from when you click start by using a eventlistener and the localstorage web API.
This application used HTML elements, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Installation
